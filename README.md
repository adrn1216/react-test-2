# Project Instructions
1. Create a git repo on GitHub. You can choose it to be private or public. Your git commits should begin from the very start (boilerplate) codebase from the time that you begin, and should show the natural growth of the solution you provide.
- Send invite links to GitHub account pictureworks as collaborators to your repository only AFTER you have finished - we will assess your solution when we receive your invite so do not send it early or you will be judged as incomplete
2. Your repository should show evidence of the following and include the following:
- Commit from your start time noting “START” in the commit description
- Commit from your finish time noting “FINISH” in the commit description
- Commits showing the growth of the codebase (i.e not one final commit) with appropriate
descriptions
- Readme documentation
3. Stack to use:
- ReactJS (Latest version)
- any other libraries you feel can save you time

Project Requirements - “Task List”
1. Write a TodoList component that expects an items prop, and a list of objects, each with text and done properties. TodoList also accepts an onItemClick function prop, which should be called when a user clicks an item in the list, if the item is not marked as done. Otherwise, the onItemClick should not be called and the click event itself should not be propagated further. The function should be called with the item object from the items list as the first parameter and the event as the second parameter. Your application should be easily installed and run via yarn.
2. Build React components and provide all source code relating to the three “Large Button” variants from the design guide at https://www.dropbox.com/s/sgruw7jkauy8ueu/react-test-library.zip?dl=0
3. Using the application you built in (1), the buttons you built in (2) and your own sense of what makes “good user experience”, update your application to be “MVP” as you understand a todo list should be. There is no need to build a back-end or add any state machine (i.e. the application can reset each load).
